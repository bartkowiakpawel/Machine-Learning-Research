# EDA Boxplots

This package focuses on visual diagnostics for our datasets. The case scripts generate boxplots and related charts that highlight distribution shifts, outliers, and scaling effects across tickers and feature groups.

What you will find:
- Standardized explorers that visualise OHLCV features, engineered indicators, and target distributions.
- Comparative studies that contrast pre- and post-scaling values, prediction errors, and multiple tickers in a single layout.
- Lightweight reporting helpers that export PNG and HTML artefacts under `outputs/` for fast sharing.
- Configuration files that keep colour themes and paths consistent across experiments.

Use these notebooks and scripts when you need a quick health check before modelling or when you want to communicate data quality findings to the rest of the team.
