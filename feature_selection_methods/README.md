# Feature Selection Methods

This package compares diverse feature selection strategies for financial modelling. The case scripts move from simple filter techniques to wrapper and embedded approaches, showing how each method reshapes model accuracy and interpretability.

Included components:
- Filter-based baselines that measure univariate relationships before modelling.
- Recursive feature elimination workflows that balance performance and feature economy.
- Embedded regularisation experiments using Lasso, Ridge, and tree-based estimators.
- Robust comparisons that document selected features, cross-validation scores, and saved artefacts in `outputs/`.

Use this package when you need guidance on trimming feature sets or when you want templates for integrating selection steps into new pipelines.
