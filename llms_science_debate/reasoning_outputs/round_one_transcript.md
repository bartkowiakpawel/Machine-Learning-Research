# Code Summary — SMA-200 Regime Analysis

This script performs a 200-day moving average (SMA-200) regime analysis for TSLA daily data.  
It loads the technical feature dataset, computes forward returns across multiple horizons,  
and labels each day as “above” or “below” the SMA-200 line. The script aggregates regime  
probabilities, as well as average and median forward returns, and derives lift metrics  
to quantify performance differences between regimes. It also generates static plots and  
optional HTML summaries using Great Tables when available.

### CSV Outputs
- **tsla_sma200_regime_summary.csv** — Per-horizon sample counts, rise/drop probabilities, and return statistics split by regime.  
- **tsla_sma200_regime_lift.csv** — Above-minus-below SMA-200 differences for all key probability and return metrics.

## GPT

From a theoretical and academic standpoint, the analysis of a technical indicator regime—specifically, the simple moving average over 200 days (SMA-200)—offers a useful case study in feature engineering for time series and financial data. Below, I expand on the experimental evidence, methodological implications, and avenues for further research, with an emphasis on generalizable principles in machine learning.

## Theoretical Perspective on Feature Engineering with Technical Regimes

### 1. **Feature Construction and Labeling**

The use of SMA-200 as a regime-defining feature is rooted in the hypothesis that long-term price trends contain information relevant for predicting future returns. In this experiment, the binary regime label (above or below SMA-200) is used as a categorical feature, which enables the partitioning of the data and subsequent calculation of conditional probabilities and return statistics.

**Strengths:**
- **Domain Knowledge Integration:** Incorporating well-established financial heuristics (like the SMA-200) can enhance model interpretability and provide a baseline for more sophisticated feature engineering.
- **Regime Segmentation:** Labeling data points by regime supports the exploration of conditional dependencies, which aligns with the literature on regime-switching models and nonlinear dynamics in time series.

**Potential Weaknesses:**
- **Information Leakage:** Care must be taken to ensure that the SMA-200 is computed using only historical data up to the prediction point (i.e., strictly causal filtering), as any lookahead bias could invalidate experimental results.
- **Feature Simplicity:** While the SMA-200 regime is interpretable, it is a univariate, threshold-based feature. More expressive, multivariate, or nonlinear features may capture additional predictive structure.

### 2. **Evaluation of Regime-Conditioned Forward Returns**

The experiment computes forward returns and rise/drop probabilities across horizons (7, 14, 21 days), split by regime. The calculation of “lift” metrics (above-minus-below regime differences) is a standard approach to quantify the incremental information provided by the regime feature.

**Observations from Results:**
- For short horizons (e.g., 7 days), the rise probability is slightly lower in the above-SMA regime, and average return lift is near zero or slightly negative. For longer horizons, average return lift becomes slightly positive, but the differences remain modest.
- Median return lift is generally negative or near zero, suggesting that the regime split may not capture significant distributional changes in forward returns, at least in this univariate context.

**Interpretation:**
- These findings are consistent with the literature, which often finds that simple moving average regimes are weak predictors when used in isolation, especially in markets with high efficiency or when transaction costs are ignored.
- The modest lifts suggest that, while there may be some regime-dependent structure, it is not strongly discriminative—at least for the sample and horizons tested.

### 3. **Methodological Reflections**

**Strengths:**
- **Transparency and Reproducibility:** The methodology is straightforward, outputs are well-documented, and CSV exports enable further analysis and replication.
- **Comprehensive Summary:** By reporting both average and median returns, as well as probabilities, the analysis addresses both location and shape of the conditional return distributions.

**Limitations:**
- **Univariate Regime Conditioning:** Only the SMA-200 is used as a regime-defining feature. This does not account for interactions with other technical or fundamental variables, nor does it capture more complex regime transitions.
- **No Model Learning:** The experiment is descriptive rather than predictive; it does not train a supervised model to learn the mapping from regime (and possibly other features) to forward returns.
- **Stationarity Assumption:** The calculation implicitly assumes stationarity within regimes, which may not hold over long samples with structural breaks or regime shifts.

# Consensus Summary: SMA-200 Regime Analysis — Academic Perspective

## Key Findings & Agreement

**Experiment Validity:**
The analysis is methodologically sound and transparent. It correctly partitions TSLA data by SMA-200 regime and computes conditional return statistics across multiple horizons (7, 14, 21 days). The lift metrics are properly calculated and outputs are reproducible.

**Core Result:**
Regime-conditioned lifts are modest to negligible:
- Rise probability lift ranges from −4.2% to −1.0% across horizons
- Average return lift is near zero (−0.0002 to +0.0059)
- Median return lift is consistently negative (−0.0074 to +0.0012)

**Interpretation:** The SMA-200 regime, when used as a univariate feature, shows weak discriminative power for forward returns in this sample. This aligns with efficient market theory and prior literature on simple moving averages.

## Agreed-Upon Methodological Strengths

1. **Causal Design:** Forward-looking returns avoid lookahead bias
2. **Multi-Horizon Evaluation:** Testing across 7, 14, 21 days captures temporal dynamics
3. **Dual Statistics:** Reporting mean *and* median mitigates outlier distortion
4. **Clear Documentation:** Reproducible outputs enable peer validation

## Agreed-Upon Risks & Limitations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|-----------|
| **Univariate Feature** | Ignores feature interactions; weak signal in isolation | Expand to multivariate regime definitions |
| **No Out-of-Sample Test** | Results may not generalize; risk of overfitting to historical data | Implement time-series cross-validation with hold-out test set |
| **Stationarity Assumption** | Regime properties may shift over time; structural breaks undetected | Perform rolling-window analysis; test for regime stability |
| **Descriptive, Not Predictive** | No supervised learning; no error bounds or confidence intervals | Train classification/regression model; compute AUC, RMSE, confidence bands |

## Recommended Next Steps (Priority Order)

### **Tier 1: Methodological Rigor**
1. **Implement Time-Series Cross-Validation**
   - Use walk-forward validation to simulate out-of-sample predictions
   - Report lift metrics on held-out test periods to assess generalization

2. **Add Confounding Controls**
   - Compute lift metrics conditional on volatility regime, sector momentum, or market regime
   - Assess whether SMA-200 lift persists after controlling for other factors

### **Tier 2: Feature Expansion**
3. **Multivariate Regime Definition**
   - Combine SMA-200 with other technical features (e.g., RSI, MACD, volatility bands)
   - Use unsupervised clustering or HMM to learn regimes data-driven

4. **Nonlinear Feature Engineering**
   - Test distance-to-SMA-200, rate of change, and interaction terms
   - Explore polynomial or spline transformations

### **Tier 3: Model Integration**
5. **Supervised Learning Pipeline**
   - Train logistic regression, random forest, or gradient boosting on regime + auxiliary features
