**Consensus Summary — SMA-200 Regime Analysis (Technical Feature Calibration)**

**Agreements:**  
- The current experiment uses an interpretable and robust approach by segmenting TSLA daily data into “above” and “below” SMA-200 regimes, evaluating forward returns across multiple horizons, and calculating lift metrics to quantify regime effects.  
- Multi-horizon analysis and regime-based lift calculations are valuable for assessing feature persistence and incremental signal.

**Key Risks & Limitations:**  
- **Data Sufficiency:** Ensure adequate sample sizes for each regime and horizon; the minimal CSV snapshot suggests results may currently be placeholder or incomplete.
- **Statistical Rigor:** Current outputs lack confidence intervals, significance testing, and effect size reporting, making it difficult to assess robustness and generalizability.
- **Potential Bias:** Watch for look-ahead bias in forward returns and survivorship bias in the TSLA data.
- **Feature Sensitivity:** The fixed 200-day SMA window may be arbitrary; nearby periods should be tested for sensitivity and robustness.
- **Model Context:** The added value of this regime feature versus other technical features or simple baselines is not yet benchmarked.

**Actionable Next Steps:**  
1. **Enhance Output:** Expand CSV summaries to include sample sizes, regime distributions, statistical significance (p-values, confidence intervals), and risk-adjusted metrics (e.g., Sharpe ratio).
2. **Statistical Testing:** Add confidence intervals and effect size calculations for lift metrics. Test for regime persistence and autocorrelation.
3. **Feature Robustness:**  
   - Test adjacent SMA periods (e.g., 150, 180, 220 days).  
   - Consider regime buffer zones to handle days near the SMA-200 line.
4. **Visualization:** Add plots of return distributions and regime transitions (e.g., box plots, violin plots).
5. **Benchmarking:** Compare regime feature lift to simple baselines (e.g., long-only, random) and test interaction with other technical features.
6. **Stress Testing:** Evaluate feature performance in distinct market environments (bull, bear, volatile periods).

**Summary Statement:**  
The current SMA-200 regime analysis provides a solid foundation for technical feature calibration but requires enhanced statistical rigor, more comprehensive outputs, and additional robustness checks to ensure meaningful, generalizable results. Focus next on statistical validation, sensitivity analysis, and feature benchmarking.
