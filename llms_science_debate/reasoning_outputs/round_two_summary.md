**Round 2 Consensus Summary: SMA-200 Regime Analysis**

### Agreements

1. **Methodological Soundness vs. Predictive Utility**: The SMA-200 regime implementation is methodologically sound, but its predictive utility is questionable due to small and inconsistent lift metrics.
2. **Univariate Feature Limitation**: The SMA-200 feature exhibits weak discriminative power, and its utility is limited by its univariate nature.
3. **Need for Multivariate Approach**: There is a need to expand the regime analysis to include other technical or fundamental features to capture more complex interactions and regime transitions.
4. **Temporal Validation**: Out-of-sample testing via time-series cross-validation is essential to assess the generalizability of the SMA-200 regime feature.

### Key Risks

1. **Statistical Rigor**: The lack of formal significance testing and confidence intervals for lift metrics poses a risk of overinterpreting noise as signal.
2. **Feature Redundancy**: The high autocorrelation of the SMA-200 feature may lead to redundancy with other trend features, potentially causing multicollinearity issues.
3. **Temporal Validity**: The stationarity assumption of the SMA-200 regime is untested, and regime stability is unknown across time, which may lead to incorrect conclusions.
4. **Data Integrity**: The consistently zero `flat_prob` across horizons suggests a potential processing artifact or thresholding issue, which may bias regime statistics.
5. **Generalization Risk**: The absence of out-of-sample testing poses a risk of overfitting to historical data, which may not generalize well to future predictions.

### Recommended Next Steps

**Phase 1: Validate Current Feature (Weeks 1-2)**

1. **Statistical Significance Testing**: Apply permutation testing and bootstrap confidence intervals to assess the statistical significance of lift metrics.
2. **Temporal Leakage Audit**: Verify that the SMA-200 calculation window does not overlap with the forward return horizon, and document exact date ranges for each observation.
3. **Regime Stationarity Diagnostics**: Partition data into rolling windows and test for structural breaks using Chow tests to assess regime stability.

**Phase 2: Multivariate Expansion and Validation (Weeks 3-6)**

1. **Multivariate Regime Definition**: Combine SMA-200 with other technical features to capture more complex interactions and improve predictive power.
2. **Nonlinear Feature Engineering**: Explore nonlinear transformations and interaction terms to potentially uncover more nuanced relationships.
3. **Supervised Learning Pipeline**: Train supervised models on regime and auxiliary features to learn the mapping to forward returns and report feature importance and confidence intervals.

By addressing these limitations and expanding the analysis through multivariate feature engineering and supervised learning, the predictive power of the SMA-200 regime analysis can be enhanced, offering more insightful and generalizable results for machine learning applications in finance.
